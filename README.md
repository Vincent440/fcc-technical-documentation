# fcc-MD-technical-documentation

freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page Created by Vincent Shury

A technical documentation site.
My idea for completing this project was to find an existing set of documentation to restyle in my own unique format.
As well as to give me the ability to add to my own docs if I needed to.

**Markdown** was the documentation that I decided would be best to make a responsive web design project.

[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) located on [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) was my primary resource for the initial docs.

Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap v4.4 to create a mobile responsive page layout.
