# fcc-MD-technical-documentation

## Description

A copy of GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) documentation site.

My idea for completing this project was to find an existing set of documentation to restyle in my own unique format.
As well as to give me the ability to customize the docs if I wanted to.

**Markdown** was the documentation that I decided would be best to make a responsive web design project.

 

On [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) was my primary resource for the initial docs.

Utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and CSS3 Media Queries for responsive design.
